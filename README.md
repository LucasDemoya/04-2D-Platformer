# 04-2D-Platformer Project
This is a 2D platformer game, 11/2/22

The point of the game is to get from point A to point B without dying. 

## Implementation
Player movement with the AWSD keys (left->A, right->D, jump->W)
Multiple Enemies with different movements
Camera follows the player
Interactive terrain: coins
HUD: displays score and lives.
